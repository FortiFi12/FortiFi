			<p><b>Brand Name Explanation:</b></p>
			<p>The name Fortifi is derived from the word fortify, which means to strengthen, protect, and prepare for challenges. It reflects the brand’s mission to empower athletes with tools that support performance, resilience, and long-term health. It's short, punchy, and memorable — perfect for a brand in the high-performance sports market.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p><b>Logo Justification:</b></p> 
			<p>The logo captures dynamic motion and energy, portraying a stylized athlete mid-sprint. The sharp, angular lines emphasize speed, power, and forward momentum, embodying the idea of pushing limits. The choice of a clean, futuristic typeface and the confident teal color conveys trust, innovation, and endurance, which are all essential pillars of Fortifi’s identity. Together, the logo and name visually and verbally reinforce the brand’s core promise of performance, recreating an environment where our products would strive.</p>

            <li>User interface patterns:</li>
			  <ul>

			<li><b>Hero Section:</b> It consists of the logo, name and slogan with the intention of capturing the visitor's attention and introducing our brand. Shows an image with 4 people running with our logo above them, encapsulating our identity and making people understand what our website is about from the beginning. </li>
			<li><b>Display Cards:</b>  Their purpose is to display multiple elements of information at one time, which were used two times on the “Home“ page (below the “Why Us”, and the “Reviews”) and once on the “About Us” page, at the “Meet the Team” section. </li>
			<li><b>Image Carousel:</b>  Used on the “Home” page at the section where we displayed our products, with the purpose of showing two different visual perspectives of our product. </li>
			<li><b>Purchase Options (Size Selecter, “Add to Cart” Button, Cart Icon in Navigation Bar and Checkout Table) :</b>  Its purpose is to replicate a real retail website that you could buy something from, with a realistic process until the “Place Order” button. </li>
			<li><b> (Intentional) Endless Spinner:</b> This is activated when pressing the “Place Order” to replicate a loading screen, replacing the payment step of the process, which were we wanted to stop with the reproduction of a real website. </li>
			<li><b>Footer with Links to social media:</b>  At the end of every page (excluding the “Corporate”) you can find a “Footer” that includes links to both our Social Media platforms (Instagram and TikTok) to further influence the customer to create bond with the brand. </li>
			<li><b>Fake Contact Us Form:</b>  As stated earlier, one of our purposes was to recreate a real website, which is why we added this page. </li>
			<li><b>Two-Column Information Display:</b>  Its purpose is to display two types of similar information at one time, with the purpose of saving space and increasing the visual appeal of the website through having a well put together structure. </li>
			<li><b>Text Carousel:</b>  This was used while showcasing our four “Values”, as part of the “About Us” page, which has the purpose of putting the spotlight on one value at a time, for full focus from the consumer. </li>
		    <li><b>Navigation Bar:</b> Carefully crafted to include every element that was needed to navigate the site, including the previously mentioned “Cart” icon. It has the “fixed-top” function to be visible at all times while browsing the website. </li>

		    </ul>
			  <br>
			  
			<li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> of our website differs from the <strong>“Home”</strong>, <strong>“Checkout”</strong>, <strong>“Contact”</strong> and <strong>“About Us”</strong> page (with a total of 4 pages excluding the “Corporate”), with each one of them having different layouts and purposes. The following paragraphs will further explain our visual vision:</li><br>
			  <ul>
			  <li><strong>Home:</strong> The homepage of FortiFi uses strong visual hierarchy to instantly communicate the brand’s core value: Performance for Life. The hero section captures attention with a bold, athletic visual and a prominently placed logo, aligning with UX principles that stress first-impression impact and clarity. This layout makes it immediately clear what FortiFi is about, which is supporting athletes through high-performance gear built for longevity. Featuring the two flagship products directly on the homepage leverages minimalist design and straightforward navigation, reducing cognitive load (Hick’s Law) while reinforcing the brand's focused and high-quality offering. Testimonials placed just beneath provide essential social proof, a critical trust-building component in UX design, and connect to FortiFi’s brand promise of empowering all levels of athletes, going from beginners to pros, with innovation they can trust. </li><br>
			  <li><strong>Contact:</strong> The contact page is designed with accessibility and reassurance in mind, echoing FortiFi’s commitment to long-term care, not just performance. From a UX perspective, it follows best practices by offering clear pathways for user interaction, whether that’s a simple contact form, email, or support option, which ensures that users feel heard and supported. This mirrors the brand’s philosophy of staying connected with the athlete beyond the point of sale, aligning with the emotional layer of the customer journey. The intuitive layout also reflects FortiFi’s approach to its products: streamlined, functional, and built to serve people who move fast and need solutions without friction. </li><br>
			  <li><strong>About Us:</strong> The About page utilizes storytelling to establish emotional resonance, a fundamental aspect of user-centered design. Rather than overwhelming visitors with stats or corporate speech, it introduces FortiFi through a narrative lens, one rooted in performance, resilience, and innovation. UX-wise, the layout favors scannability and connection, while the content builds trust by showcasing the brand’s “why.” This structure supports FortiFi’s deeper mission: empowering athletes to push forward while protecting their bodies, reinforcing the brand as not just a product provider but a long-term partner in performance. </li>

			  </ul>
			  <br>
              
                <li><strong>How does the website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong></li>
				<li>FortiFi’s website design reflects the brand’s core values, which are performance, durability, and innovation, showing them through its clean, dynamic layout and confident visual presence. The bold hero image, sharp typography, and minimal color palette communicate strength and clarity, aligning with FortiFi’s commitment to helping athletes perform at their best for the long run. Every page avoids clutter, focusing instead on ease, speed, and efficiency, just like the products themselves. The design tone is energized but professional, echoing FortiFi’s personality as a brand that’s serious about performance but human at its core. This clarity and athletic boldness ensure the website doesn’t just inform, it embodies the very essence of the brand.</li>
<br>
                <li><strong>How does the website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</strong></li>
				<li>FortiFi’s marketing and communication strategy focuses on building trust, educating users, and highlighting results, and the website design supports this seamlessly. Key product benefits are front and center, testimonials provide immediate social proof, and navigation is intuitive, helping users get what they need quickly without friction. The visual emphasis on real athletes and functional design elements reinforces messaging around science-backed gear for real performance. The site also aligns with the brand’s channel strategy by providing shareable, high-impact content for social, and offering a clear route from inspiration to purchase, driving conversions through both storytelling and usability.</li>
<br>
                <li><strong>How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?</strong></li>
				<li>FortiFi’s unique value lies in its science-driven, high-performance injury support gear designed for long-term use, and the website brings this to life through smart design. By showcasing the two main products with focused descriptions, highlighting core features like support, flexibility, and breathability, and pairing these with real-world testimonials, the site makes the products’ purpose and edge crystal clear. Strategic placement of reviews and feature callouts reinforces that FortiFi isn’t just about recovery, it’s about optimizing longevity in movement. The layout enables quick scanning and deeper dives, giving both curious visitors and serious athletes what they need to understand why FortiFi is different, and why it matters.</li>

          <ul class="white">
            <li>Your testing <strong>goals</strong>:</li>
			  <li>The primary goal of our user testing was to evaluate the effectiveness and clarity of our website’s user experience (UX) and interface design (UI), and to identify any usability issues that could interfere with user engagement or conversion. We aimed to understand how intuitive the navigation was, how well the product pages communicated value, and how smooth the purchasing journey felt. Additionally, we wanted to observe if users could easily find key information (such as pricing, product details, and reviews), and whether the overall design had ultimately aligned with FortiFi’s brand identity.</li><br>
			  <li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>(participants ,setting &amp;protocol):</li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Participants</strong>: The testing was conducted with 4 participants, each fitting the brand’s target demographics to varying degrees. All were within the ideal age range and currently living in the Netherlands, aligning with FortiFi’s primary geographic audience. Importantly, all participants had moderate to advanced experience with browsing websites and online shopping, making them highly capable of providing insightful UX/UI feedback. While they weren’t all directly within the athlete niche, their familiarity with digital interfaces allowed them to critically evaluate design, structure, and flow from a user-centered perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting</strong>: All user tests were conducted in person, ensuring direct observation and real-time feedback. Two sessions took place in a home environment, while the remaining two were conducted on campus, simulating everyday settings where users are most likely to explore FortiFi’s site. The tests were done on laptops, which best reflect the device type most commonly used for online product browsing and purchasing. This hybrid environment allowed us to account for varied user contexts and ensured our design remained accessible and functional across real-world usage scenarios.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocol</strong>: Participants were first given a brief introduction to the FortiFi brand and the purpose of the website, especially if they were not part of earlier research interviews and were unfamiliar with the brand context. They were encouraged to navigate freely and provide honest, unfiltered feedback on aspects they found intuitive, confusing, or visually off-brand.
				Tasks varied slightly between sessions, reflecting the different development stages of the website, which proved extremely valuable. Early participants focused on testing core navigation and product discovery, while later participants interacted more deeply with product selection, cart functionality, and informational tabs. Across all tests, a focus remained on assessing the clarity of the product offering and ease of completing a purchase-related task.
				Feedback was mostly gathered in real-time through observation and discussion, as most usability concerns became immediately apparent through user interaction. We recorded their comments and reactions informally, allowing us to pinpoint pain points and return to development with clear, actionable improvements. This iterative feedback cycle significantly shaped our design decisions and helped us fine-tune the experience for future users.</li>

            <li>Your testing <strong>results</strong>: <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/221162_buas_nl/EiaBbuyGYvxLlemkudFa7xcBuaiHspdTwNnSfaaT0ZUdGw?e=8RoaO9">User Testing Videos Folder</a>
              <ul>
                <li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance:</li>
				  <ul>
				  <li><strong>Easy to Navigate:</strong> All participants successfully completed their tasks without additional guidance, indicating that the website’s layout, menu structure, and overall navigation are highly intuitive. This is essential for user retention and conversions, especially for a product-driven site like FortiFi’s.</li>
				  <li><strong>Glitches/Bugs with Product Purchasing:</strong> While the site was largely functional, minor bugs, particularly with the shopping cart and navigation—interrupted the user flow. These friction points can directly impact user trust and sales, making this issue a top priority for improvement.</li>
				  <li><strong>Clear Product Focus:</strong> The homepage and product sections clearly communicate what FortiFi offers. Testers appreciated the strong visual and textual emphasis on the knee and elbow braces, which helped them quickly understand the product’s purpose and value.</li>
				  <li><strong>Visually Appealing:</strong> The completed sections of the site, such as the hero image, buttons, and product cards, were described as clean and aesthetically pleasing. The visual identity aligns well with FortiFi’s brand, energetic, bold, and empowering, especially through its use of whitespace and structured layout.</li>
				  <li><strong>Unfinished or Overwhelming Content Blocks:</strong> Long or placeholder text, particularly in the value section, disrupted readability. Testers found it hard to digest and suggested more concise writing or collapsible sections to keep the flow smooth. While not a dealbreaker, it reduces polish and professionalism.</li>
				  <li><strong>Images or Elements Not Loading:</strong> Issues such as the logo disappearing on mobile or missing product visuals were flagged. Though quickly fixed, such bugs momentarily hurt the credibility of the brand and could confuse users.</li>
				  </ul>
                <li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website:</li>
				  <ul>
				  <li>Fixed cart update and interaction bugs</li>
				  <li>Corrected image and logo loading errors</li>
				  <li>Improved mobile responsiveness</li>
				  <li>Revised navigation structure</li>
				  <li>Adjusted text length and placement</li>
				  </ul>
				<li>Improvements that would be implemented in a hypothetical future:</li>
				  <ul>
				  <li>Make long text sections collapsible</li>
				  <li>Add search functionality</li>
				  <li>Add hover states and microinteractions</li>
				  <li>Improve accessibility features</li>
				  <li>Introduce user reviews or testimonials dynamically</li>
				  <li>Expand product options or customizations</li>
				  <li>Integrate analytics to track user behavior</li>
				  <li>Add a sticky navigation bar</li>
				  </ul>
              </ul>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities:</h4>
          <p>The campaign aimed to build brand awareness, engage with our target audience, and drive traffic to our landing page in preparation for the launch of our AI-brace. We focused on connecting with athletes who value both high performance and long-term health. </p>
		  <p><strong>What is our brand about?</strong></p>
		  <p>Fortifi is an AI-driven sports technology brand focused on injury prevention, performance enhancement and athlete empowerment. Our Ai brace uses real-time biomechanical date to detect imbalances and motion errors, helping athletes reach their full potential -safely and confidently.</p>
		  <p><strong>What did we do in terms of promotional activities?</strong></p>
		  <p>For the Fortifi campaign, we executed a series of promotional activities to create awareness, educate our audience and generate excitement for the launch of Fortifi. We designed and posted a combination of motivational videos, injury prevention tips and educational carousels across Instagram and TikTok. We interacted with our community by using interactive polls on Instagram Stories.</p>
	      <p>All content was designed to send traffic to our landing page, where the product's value proposition was showcased, along with athlete endorsements, to establish trust and interest. </p>
		  <p>To maintain consistency, we adhered to a 4-week content calendar, posting 3-4 times weekly to both Instagram and TikTok. At the beginning of the campaign, we experimented with posting times to identify when our Target audience were most active, so that we can publish more efficiently. </p>
		  <p>We monitored weekly performance based on important measures such as reach, engagement, and interactions. Through that, we were able to identify what worked and optimize the content by paying attention to the format and the topics that most engaged our audience. </p>
		  <p><strong>Reasoning for Channels/Platforms used in the Communication and Media Plan - Media Tactics</strong></p>
		  <p>Why Instagram?</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Large User Base: As of April 2024, Instagram had approximately 8.82 million users in the Netherlands, accounting for 50.4% of the population. The largest user group was individuals aged 25 to 34, comprising 2.4 million users. (Instagram Users in Netherlands - April 2024, 2024) </li>
			<li>Visual &amp; Informative: Features like Reels, Stories, and Carousels allow for clear demonstrations of your AI-powered knee brace, showcasing its functionality and benefits effectively. </li>
			<li>Community Engagement: The platform enables direct interaction through comments, direct messages, and interactive stickers (such as polls, Q&amp;A, and quizzes), creating a sense of community and building brand trust. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Why TikTok?</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Growing Popularity: As of January 2024, TikTok had over six million users in the Netherlands, with a significant portion aged 20 to 24 years—a key demographic for sports and fitness products. (Statista, 2024)  </li>
			<li>Potential: TikTok’s algorithm prioritizes content discovery, making it easier for new brands to go viral and reach audiences beyond their immediate followers. </li>
			<li>Short-Form Video Appeal: The platform excels at delivering quick, engaging content, ideal for product demonstrations, athlete testimonials, and injury prevention tips related to our knee brace. </li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>Overall Benefits:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Video-First Content: Both platforms support video-centric content, which is ideal for explaining how the AI knee brace works and demonstrating its real-world benefits. </li>
			<li>Influencer Collaborations: Partnering with influencers on these platforms can drive trust and credibility among potential customers. </li>
			<li>Targeted Advertising: Both Instagram and TikTok offer paid advertising options that allow for precise targeting of athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and individuals prone to knee injuries. </li>
			<li>By using Instagram and TikTok, you can effectively increase brand awareness, educate potential customers, and drive conversions through engaging, shareable content tailored to the Dutch market. </li>
		  </ul>
			
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p><strong>What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign?</strong></p>
		  <p>Firstly, and most importantly, we learned how difficult it is to execute a whole marketing campaign not on one but on two platforms. Finding the time to shoot the content was also difficult, considering everyone in our team was in a different department. Nevertheless, we still managed to make the most of the time we had. Staying consistent with the posts was also challenging, which is something we can learn from. In the beginning, we were posting up to 4 times a week, which went down to 2 as the final week approached because of other deadlines. Nevertheless, we learnt that having people to rely on is crucial, especially when half of the team had very limited experience with marketing before this project. </p>
		  <p><strong>What worked and what didn’t?</strong></p>
	      <p>It's crucial to first take into account the platforms we focused on during the project, namely Instagram and TikTok, in order to appropriately answer. Our content strategy revolved around these two channels, and a lot of what we discovered is directly related to the way our audience responded to our postings on these social media. </p>
		  <p>We began our campaign with Instagram and TikTok since our insights showed us that our target audience mainly uses those two platforms. Interestingly enough, Instagram was an instant success for our campaign with us managing to achieve most of our campaign goals within the 2-week mark. Consequently, we had to keep increasing the campaign goals so our progress wouldn’t stagnate. People enjoyed the video content we were posting and interacted with it. However, when it came to TikTok, we did not have as much success, which was unexpected since we knew the algorithm of TikTok helped a lot when it comes to new accounts. We only managed to get a small portion of the following we were expecting to accumulate. We did receive some views but still not enough.  </p>
		  <p>When it comes to content, we saw that real video content with people/athletes was way more attractive and engaging than normal carousels and motivational photos. Our interview insights confirmed that in theory as well as in practice video content is preferred over any other type of content. Moreover, inspirational and motivational videos also did great. They led the most natural (non-following) traffic to our page. However, when we posted those same videos on TikTok, they did not perform as well, even though they still did better than any of the other posts we made. </p>
		  <p><strong>What went as expected and what didn’t?</strong></p>
	      <p>As we already mentioned, our interview insights showed us that our target audience prefers real-life videos of people/athletes over anything else. That was confirmed in our Instagram campaign very clearly. However, we did not expect less success on TikTok. We were hopeful that the algorithm would push our videos to the For You pages of our target audience, which was not the case. Moreover, even though informational content was not one of the main types of content our target audience mentioned when asked about their preference, they still expressed interest in it when asked. Looking at our insights in both social media we can clearly see that it underperformed heavily, which was not expected. This leads us to think that the interviewees might have said they were interested in some other form of informational content – not carousels. </p>
		  <p><strong>What would we do differently?</strong></p>
	      <p>We would focus more on video content than anything else because the numbers on both social media show a positive correlation between this type of content and impressions/reach. Moreover, we would try to create less AI content as it did not perform as well as our own content. Even though it did help in times when we did not have time to work, we would like to reduce the number of AI posts. Moreover, we would also try to post more video-based informational content rather than carousels or basic posts to try and see if it would make a difference. Furthermore, we think that it would have been better to put more focus on TikTok since, after the Instagram boom, we mainly focused on it because we thought it would be way harder to grow an Instagram page than a TikTok one. As a matter of fact, it was not.</p>
			
			
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In the past month, we have learnt a lot as a brand and as a marketing team. If we had more time, we would definitely focus more on video content of people/athletes who are somehow associated with our brand, since those videos performed best out of any other type of content we posted. They created the most engagement for our page and gathered the most impressions. In the future, we would think about investing in sponsorships from well-known professional athletes if we could amass a sizable enough fan base and obtain the necessary funding. Our insights from recent interviews confirmed that people are much more likely to believe and engage with content or purchase products when they are promoted by a familiar and respected sportsman/sportswoman </p>
          <p>In addition to athlete-focused content, another format that has proven successful is motivational edits. These types of videos, which combine inspiring visuals with powerful messaging, have also driven strong engagement and positive sentiment from our community and reached a larger audience outside of our following than the real video content of people.  </p>
          <p>Moreover, our informational content did not produce nearly as much impact as the rest of our content, which leads us to the conclusion that we should reduce the amount of informational content. However, we understand that this type of content might not be that engaging, but it is vital for people who are actually interested in purchasing our product, which was also mentioned in our interviews. If we were to continue our campaign, we would most definitely reduce the amount of informational content, but not get rid of it completely. Instead of posting informational content once a 1-2 times per week, we would do 1-2 times per two weeks. </p>
		  <p>Finally, if we had more time, we would try to expand our content to new platforms such as YouTube. Our research and user feedback have indicated a growing interest in more in-depth, long-form content, even if our present efforts have mostly concentrated on short-form content for platforms like Instagram and TikTok. YouTube will allow us to create deeper bonds with our followers since we will focus on comprehensive stories, provide behind-the-scenes insights, and share valuable content such as training routines, athlete interviews, product breakdowns, and motivational documentaries. </p>
